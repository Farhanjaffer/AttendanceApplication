As a trainee at Bhilai Steel Plant, I was involved in developing a geographical location-based app using Flutter. Responsibilities include coding, feature implementation, and designing the user interface with Figma for an intuitive and visually appealing experience. It provided hands-on experience in software development, honed my skills in coding and UI/UX design, and offered practical insights into the industrial application of technology within the geological sector. This experience significantly enhanced my expertise and prepared me for future endeavors in the field of technology and industrial applications.
